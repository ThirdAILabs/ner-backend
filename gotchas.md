- pdfjs-dist fixed to 4.8.69 because this is what react-pdftotext 1.3.4 uses. By installing the same version, we can use the worker script in pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.mjs instead of downloading from cloudflare. This solved the following error: `Failed to extract text from PDF: Error: Setting up worker failed: "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: app://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/4.8.69/pdf.worker.mjs`
