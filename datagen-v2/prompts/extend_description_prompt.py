When a tag has minimal or vague description, you should generate a more complete and informative one using the tagâ€™s name and examples. Make sure that the description is within 100 words 

Your expanded description should explain:
### What the tag represents
### When it is typically used
### Any patterns or rules that help identify when the tag applies

Keep the tone concise, objective, and suitable for use in a tagging guideline or labeling system.
