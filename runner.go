Effective April 26, 2013, DHS began automating the admission process. An alien lawfully
admitted or paroled into the U.S. is no longer required to be in possession of a
preprinted Form I-94. A record of admission printed from the CBP website constitutes a
lawful record of admission. See 8 CFR ยง 1.4(d).
If an employer, local, state or federal agency requests admission information, present
your admission (I-94) number along with any additional required documents requested
by that employer or agency.
Note: For security reasons, we recommend that you close your browser after you have
finished retrieving your I-94 number.
