# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (used in the toolbar)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (used in the Chrome extension management page)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (used in the Chrome extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (used in the Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons by:

1. **Using a simple logo/symbol** that represents NER (Named Entity Recognition)
2. **Using text-based icons** with "NER" or "N" letters
3. **Using online icon generators** like:
   - Favicon.io
   - RealFaviconGenerator.net
   - Canva
   
## Design Guidelines

- Use clear, simple designs that work well at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
- Consider using your brand colors or professional colors like blue/green
- Make sure the 16px version is still readable

## Current Status

The extension will work without these icons (Chrome will use default icons), but custom icons will provide a better user experience.

To add icons, simply place the PNG files with the exact names listed above in this directory.
